<h1><a id="feature-integrate" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Feature Integrate</h1><p>This feature allows to read sql data and store it in C# code. It is part of the cli command <strong>generate</strong>. Such data can be embedded in:</p><ul><li>Application</li><li>Cli</li></ul><p>Later the data can be deployed for example to an other database with the cli command <strong>deploydb</strong>. This process works for specially structured data.</p><p></p><h2><a id="example-language" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Example Language</h2><p>By default an application might support English, German and French. However a client might add an additional language and translate the application. Let's say into Italian. The manufacturer decides later to add Italian and the translation to his application by default. The <strong>Integrate</strong> feature allows now to read and store the Italian language and it's translation into the main C# repository. And make it part of the deployment process.</p><p></p><h1><a id="sql-data-to-c#-code-and-back" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>SQL Data to C# Code and Back</h1><p></p><ul><li>Cli command <strong>generate</strong> (Sql Data to C# Code)</li><li>Cli command <strong>deploydb</strong> (C# Code to Sql Data)</li></ul><img src="/assets/feature-integrate.png" alt="/assets/feature-integrate.png" />
