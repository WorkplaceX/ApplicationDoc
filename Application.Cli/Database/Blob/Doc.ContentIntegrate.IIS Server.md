# Local IIS Server <i class="fas fa-server"></i>
WorkplaceX web application runs on local IIS server on Windows 10.

In order to run .NET applications on local IIS server install:

* [.NET Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) (ASP.NET Core. Click **Hosting Bundle**, not x86 or x64!)
* [Node for IIS](https://github.com/Azure/iisnode/releases) (Click file: **iisnode-full.msi**)

For SSL see: [SSL Installation](https://github.com/WorkplaceX/Util/tree/master/SSL)

After successful installation Windows "add remove programs" should look like this:
